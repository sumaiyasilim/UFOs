# UFOs
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage that could provide more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings. We do this by creating table filters for the date, city, state, country and shape. This would allow for users to be able to filter for multiple criteria at the same time

## Results
To perform a search, the user would type into one or multiple of the boxes to filter the data. For example, if they wanted to get the UFO sightings in the United States, then more specifically in Florida, they would type “us” into the “Enter a Country” box, then type “fl” in the “Enter a State” box. The results would look like the image below:

## Summary
Overall, this website works great for the searches the users would want to do, the drawback about the search boxes is that they are case sensitive. So, if a user uses uppercase for any of the searches, then the table would show up blank like the image below where the input in the state box has a capitalized letter:

### Additional Recommendations
-	The first recommendation would address the capitalization issue. An improvement would include the search bars allowing for capitalization without affecting the results

-	The second recommendation would be to give the users a drop-down bar in the search boxes to allow them to see what search options within each filter that they have. This would allow for a more seamless searching experience.
